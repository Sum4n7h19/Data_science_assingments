    "**Overfitting:** Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, capturing noise or random fluctuations in the data that do not represent the underlying patterns. As a result, the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data.\n",

    "**Consequences of Overfitting:**\n",
    "- Poor generalization to new data.\n",
    "- High accuracy on training data but low accuracy on test/validation data.\n",

    "**Mitigation of Overfitting:**\n",
    "- Cross-validation: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess model performance on different subsets of the data.\n",

    "Data encoding refers to the process of converting data from one format or representation to another. In the context of data science, encoding is commonly used to convert categorical or textual data into a numerical format that can be easily processed by machine learning algorithms. The goal is to represent information in a way that can be efficiently utilized for analysis and model training.\n",

    "Q1: Difference between t-test and z-test:\n",
    "- **T-Test:** A t-test is used to compare the means of two groups to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between them. It is typically used when the sample size is small, and the population standard deviation is unknown. The t-test is based on the t-distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example Scenario: You want to test if a new drug is effective in reducing blood pressure. You have a small sample of 30 patients, and you measure their blood pressure before and after taking the drug. You use a t-test to compare the means of the before and after measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Z-Test:** A z-test is used when you have a larger sample size (typically n > 30) and know the population standard deviation. It is used to compare sample data to a known population or to compare two large samples. The z-test is based on the standard normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example Scenario: You are analyzing the weights of a population of adult males. You have a sample of 100 individuals, and you know the population standard deviation. You use a z-test to determine if the sample mean differs significantly from the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: One-Tailed vs. Two-Tailed Tests:\n",
    "- **One-Tailed Test:** In a one-tailed test, you are interested in the possibility of an effect in only one direction, either greater than or less than a certain value. It is used when you have a specific hypothesis about the direction of the effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example: Testing whether a new fertilizer increases crop yield. You are only interested in whether it increases yield, not decreases it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Two-Tailed Test:** In a two-tailed test, you are interested in the possibility of an effect in either direction, greater than or less than a certain value. It is used when you want to determine if there is any significant difference, regardless of the direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example: Testing whether a new drug affects heart rate. You want to know if it can increase or decrease heart rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: Type 1 and Type 2 Errors:\n",
    "- **Type 1 Error (False Positive):** This occurs when you reject a true null hypothesis. In other words, you conclude that there is an effect or difference when there isn't one.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example: You mistakenly conclude that a person is guilty of a crime when they are actually innocent (a wrongful conviction).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type 2 Error (False Negative):** This occurs when you fail to reject a false null hypothesis. In other words, you conclude that there is no effect or difference when there is one.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example: You fail to detect a serious disease in a patient even though they have it, leading to a missed diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: Bayes's Theorem:\n",
    "Bayes's Theorem is a mathematical formula used to update the probability for a hypothesis as new evidence becomes available. It is particularly useful in conditional probability and Bayesian statistics. The formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)}\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Suppose you want to find the probability of a patient having a disease (A) given a positive test result (B). You know the probability of a positive test result if the patient has the disease (P(B|A)), the prior probability of the patient having the disease (P(A)), and the overall probability of a positive test result (P(B)). Bayes's Theorem helps you update the probability of the patient having the disease after the test result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: Confidence Interval:\n",
    "A confidence interval is a range of values around a sample statistic that is used to estimate a population parameter with a certain level of confidence. It provides a range of values within which the true parameter is likely to fall. The formula to calculate a confidence interval for the population mean (μ) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[CI = \\bar{X} ± Z * (s / √n)\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\(\\bar{X}\\) is the sample mean.\n",
    "- Z is the Z-score associated with the desired confidence level (e.g., 1.96 for a 95% confidence level).\n",
    "- s is the sample standard deviation.\n",
    "- n is the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: You have a sample of 100 students, and you want to estimate the average height of all students in your school with a 95% confidence level. You calculate the confidence interval using the formula and find that the height is between 160 cm and 170 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6: Bayes's Theorem Example:\n",
    "Let's say you want to calculate the probability of a patient having a rare disease given some prior information and a new diagnostic test.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prior Probability: The probability of the patient having the disease before any test information (P(A) = 0.01, which is 1%).\n",
    "- Test Sensitivity: The probability of a positive test result when the patient has the disease (P(B|A) = 0.95, which is 95%).\n",
    "- Test Specificity: The probability of a negative test result when the patient doesn't have the disease (P(not B|not A) = 0.90, which is 90%).\n",
    "- Test Positivity: The probability of a positive test result in general (P(B) = 0.099, which is 9.9%).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can use Bayes's Theorem to find the probability of the patient having the disease after the positive test:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) * P(A)}{P(B)}\\]\n",
    "\\[P(A|B) = \\frac{0.95 * 0.01}{0.099}\\]\n",
    "\\[P(A|B) ≈ 0.959\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "So, given the positive test result, there is approximately a 95.9% probability that the patient has the disease."

    "Q7: Calculate the 95% Confidence Interval:\n",
    "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for a sample with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 5, you can use the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[CI = \\bar{X} ± Z * \\frac{s}{√n}\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\(\\bar{X}\\) is the sample mean (50).\n",
    "- Z is the Z-score for a 95% confidence level (1.96).\n",
    "- s is the sample standard deviation (5).\n",
    "- n is the sample size (you didn't provide it, so I'll assume n = 30).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, plug in the values:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[CI = 50 ± 1.96 * \\frac{5}{√30}\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate the values:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[CI ≈ 50 ± 1.96 * (2.8867)\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives a 95% confidence interval of approximately 44.66 to 55.34.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: With 95% confidence, the true population mean is estimated to be between 44.66 and 55.34 based on the sample mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8: Margin of Error and Sample Size:\n",
    "The margin of error (MOE) is a measure of the accuracy of a confidence interval. It is determined by the confidence level, standard deviation, and sample size. The formula for the MOE is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[MOE = Z * \\frac{s}{√n}\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where Z is the critical value associated with the desired confidence level. A larger sample size (n) leads to a smaller MOE. In other words, as you increase the sample size, the confidence interval becomes more precise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In a political poll, a sample of 1000 respondents results in a smaller MOE compared to a poll with 100 respondents. A larger sample provides a more accurate estimate of the population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9: Calculate Z-Score:\n",
    "To calculate the Z-score for a data point with a value of 75, a population mean of 70, and a population standard deviation of 5, use the formula:\n",

    "\\[Z = \\frac{X - μ}{σ}\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- X is the data point (75).\n",
    "- μ is the population mean (70).\n",
    "- σ is the population standard deviation (5).\n",
    "\n",
    "Plug in the values:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[Z = \\frac{75 - 70}{5}\\]\n",
    "\\[Z = \\frac{5}{5}\\]\n",
    "\\[Z = 1.0\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: A Z-score of 1.0 means that the data point is 1 standard deviation above the mean in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10: Hypothesis Test with a t-test:\n",
    "To conduct a hypothesis test for the effectiveness of the weight loss drug at a 95% confidence level using a t-test, you need more information, specifically the hypothesized population mean (null hypothesis) and the alternative hypothesis. For this example, let's assume:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Null Hypothesis (H0): The drug is not significantly effective (μ = 0).\n",
    "- Alternative Hypothesis (H1): The drug is significantly effective (μ ≠ 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can perform a two-tailed t-test using the sample mean, standard deviation, sample size, and the t-distribution to calculate the t-statistic and compare it to the critical t-value at a 95% confidence level. If the t-statistic falls in the rejection region, you can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the drug is significantly effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11: Calculate the 95% Confidence Interval for Proportion:\n",
    "To calculate the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of people satisfied with their job, use the formula for a confidence interval for a proportion:\n",

    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\(\\hat{p}\\) is the sample proportion (0.65 for 65%).\n",
    "- Z is the Z-score for a 95% confidence level (approximately 1.96).\n",
